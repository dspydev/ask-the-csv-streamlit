# ask-the-csv-streamlit

This app allows you to upload a CSV file and ask questions about the data using an OpenAI language model. Follow these steps to get started:

- Upload a CSV file: Use the file uploader below to upload a CSV file containing the data you want to query.
- Select or enter a query: Once you have uploaded a file, you can select an example query from the dropdown list or choose 'Other' to enter your own custom query.
- Enter your OpenAI API key: You will need to enter your OpenAI API key to use the language model. If you don't have an API key, you can sign up for one on the OpenAI website.
- View the results: After entering your query and API key, the app will generate a response to your query using the OpenAI language model and display it below.
